# Make Technology coding exam

### Problem
 * Create a web app that allows a user to create a workout program (e.g. Cardio - 30 mins - MWF )
    * User is able to update the frequency of each item in the program
    * Each workout program must have a timeframe (keep it simple, 1 week, 2 months, etc)
    * If you can, have a daily/weekly/monthly view of the routines
    * User must be able to add new routines and update existing items


### Tech Stack
* Any tech stack you're comfortable with, but we prefer if your API is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS
